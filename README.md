# **CS50: Web Programming with Python and JavaScript - Solutions**

Welcome to my repository for exercises and projects completed as part of [CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript](https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/). 
This course picks up where CS50x leaves off, diving more deeply into the design and implementation of web apps with Python, JavaScript, and SQL using frameworks like Django, React, and Bootstrap. Topics include database design, scalability, security, and user experience. Through hands-on projects, students learn to write and use APIs, create interactive UIs, and leverage cloud services like GitHub.

## **About This Repository**
This repository contains my solutions to the lecture tasks and problem sets for CS50â€™s Web Programming course. 

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: Backend logic and server-side programming
- **Flask**: Lightweight web framework for Python
- **Django**: Full-stack web framework for more complex projects
- **SQL**: Database queries and management
- **HTML/CSS**: Structure and styling for web pages
- **JavaScript**: Client-side interactivity and dynamic content
- **APIs**: Interaction with external services
- **React**: JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces

## **Learning Objectives**
Through these exercises, I am building advanced skills in:
- Web design and development
- Backend programming and APIs
- Database integration and management
- Full-stack application development
- Creating user-centric, accessible web applications
